Amazon S3 can be used to host a static website. For hosting dynamic websites, other AWS services can be used.

To configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting, the AWS Management Console (the web UI) can be used, without the need to write any code. To do so, you first need to configure the bucket and then upload your website content.

# Create a new bucket with public access
To create a new bucket, open the AWS Management Console and go to the S3 service. On the left-hand side choose a section named **Buckets**. Once in the section, click on the **Create bucket** button. Give your new bucket a name. This name has to be unique across the whole global AWS infrastructure. Choose the bucket region. It should be the closest region to where you are located. Click on **Next**.

You do not need any additional settings in the **Configure options** tab, so click on **Next**. In the **Set permissions** tab, you have the option of blocking all public access enabled by default. In order for your website to be accessible from the Internet, you need to allow that access. Untick the option.

You will see a warning, but as you can see it strictly relates to this use case:

_AWS recommends that you block all public access to your bucket unless public access is required for specific and verified use cases such as static website hosting._

To proceed, you have to tick the acknowledgment box.

Click on **Next** and **Create bucket**.

# Create a policy for the bucket

You have to create a bucket policy so that anyone has read access to all objects inside it. The easiest way is to go inside the bucket, open **Permissions**, then **Bucket Policy** and at the bottom of the page there is a link to a policy generator. Open it in a separate tab. On this page, you will also find the ARN (Amazon Resource Number) of your S3 bucket. Copy it as you will need it in a moment.

The settings in the policy generator should be as follows:

Select Type of Policy: **S3 Bucket Policy**

Effect: **Allow**

Principal: **\*** (all objects in the bucket)

AWS Service: **Amazon S3**

Action: **GetObject** (anyone will have read access to anything that is inside the bucket, which is exactly what you want for a publicly accessible website)

Amazon Resource Name: _paste the ARN you previously copied and add the slash and wildcard at the end, in my case it is_ **arn:aws:s3:::some-super-unique-name/\***

Click on **Add Statement** and **Generate Policy**. The policy JSON document is generated. Copy it and paste it back into the **Bucket policy editor**. Click on **Save**.

# Upload a website to the S3 bucket

Now it is time to upload your files to the bucket. You can download an HTML5 template for free from multiple sources on the Internet.

# Enable S3 website hosting

The last step is to allow the S3 bucket to actually respond to requests from a browser. Go to **Properties** tab, then **Static website hosting** and click on the option **Use this bucket to host a website**. You need to provide an index document, which in general is stored in the _index.html_ file (check your HTML template for that). Click on **Save**. 

When you click on the **Static website hosting** option again, you will see your website endpoint at the top.
